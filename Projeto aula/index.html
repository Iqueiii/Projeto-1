   Ain't got antlers on my walls
But I sure know mating calls
From the stalls in the bars on a Friday night
And other boys may need a map
But I can close my eyes
And have you wrapped around my fingers like that

So, baby
When you need the job done
You can call me, baby

'Cause you ain't gotta tell me
It's just in my nature
So take it like a taker
'Cause, baby, I'm a giver
Ain't no need to hurry
'Cause, baby, I deliver
Ain't no country boy quitter
I get the job done
I get the job done

Girl, I don't need no lifted truck
Revving loud to pick you up
'Cause how I look is how I touch
And in this strip-mall town of dreams
Good luck finding a man who has the means
To rhinestone cowgirl all night long

So, baby
If you never had one
You can call me, baby, yeah

'Cause you ain't gotta tell me
It's just in my nature
So take it like a taker
'Cause, baby, I'm a giver
Ain't no need to hurry
'Cause, baby, I deliver
Ain't no country boy quitter
I get the job done
I get the job done

Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na (she gets the job done)
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na (she gets the job done)
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na

'Cause you ain't gotta tell me
It's just in my nature
So take it like a taker
'Cause, baby, I'm a giver
Ain't no need to hurry
'Cause, baby, I deliver
Ain't no country boy quitter
I get the job done
I get the job done

I get the job done
I get the job done
I get the job done
Yes, ma'am
Yes, I do
You're welcome
